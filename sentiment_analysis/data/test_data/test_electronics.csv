ADVANTAGES ARE: 
1) The ONLY smaller desktop unit that I found with CD-MP3-AM-FM RADIO and remote. 
2) Has sleep timer 30 minutes, 60 minutes, 90 and 120 minutes. This is handy for CD's, MP3's and the radio. 
3) Fairly good sound for the money.
4) Easy to use remote. (I leave mine next to the unit).
DISADVANTAGES ARE:
1) Earphone plug in the back of the unit. When I want to plug in my earphone, it is hard to reach this and it is a poor design!
2) My biggest disappointment--no resume on CD or MP3! I listen to alot of audio books and I find this a real inconveince! I have to go to the track that I think I left off or write it down! (My Panasonic MP3 CD small portable has this, why did they forget this in this one?). 
3) Terrible reception on AM--STATIC!
4) Sound equalizer needs much improvement for the sound quality and ease of use.
I bought this because it is the only AM/FM/CD/MP3/CASSETTE unit with a timer and remote that I could find! Since the AM radio is so terrible, I ended up buying the Sony ICF-M410V so I can listen to my AM talk shows. This one has a sleep timer up to 60 minutes, a clock and easy to use.
Overall, I still give it a 4 because of it's many features and that it has a cassette for my older tapes. **And, I wish I would have bought it on Amazon, not at Radio Shack (they were about $25 more). Live and learn! If you are looking for a all in one with CD, MP3, CASSETTE, REMOTE AND AM-FM RADIO, this is about the only one that you will find and I looked for 3 months!
UPDATE: September 18, 2006: After owning this one month, I like it better and better! I love the SLEEP feature that you can use up to 120 minutes (2 hours) either on the radio or the CD! This AUTOMATICALLY shuts the unit off. It is a great feature if you are listening to a CD that contains 40 hours of MP3's on it and you don't want it to play all night","Daisy S ""Daisy S""",100

17,"B00009YUPS:a_really_cool_device,_with_some_limitations:michael_the_city-dwelling_hermit",ADS Tech DVD Express 2.0 (USBAV-701): Electronics,"A really cool device, with some limitations","First of all, here are my computer specs:
Pentium 4 2.8 GHz/800 FSB
1 GB DDR2 RAM
2 SATA 7200 RPM hard drives: 80 GB (boot drive), 250 GB (movie drive)
Graphics card: ATI Radeon X300 PCIe 128mb
Sound card: SoundBlaster Live 24-bit
VCR: consumer-grade Sony SLV-N750

My DVD Xpress model number: USBAV-701 Rev. 2

My purpose: To archive old tapes to DVD.

Installation of the drivers/software was a quick and painless process. Within minutes, I was already capturing my very first video. This unit works very nicely with retail VHS tapes (I found that it does not respond to Macrovision, though I only tested one tape), home movies, and off-air master tapes (tapes that were recorded from television broadcasts). At first, I captured a short promotional music video at 8 Mb/s in a resolution of 720x480. This produced a video which was at least as good as the original tape. There are bars around the borders of the screen when viewed on a computer, but televisions have something called overscan which prevents all the extraneous stuff at the borders from being seen.

Then I captured a longer home movie, which clocked in at under two hours but would not fit on a single-layer DVD. My original bitrate of 8 Mb/s was too high, and the higher bitrate wasn't really helping the video quality too much. But if my bitrate is too low, the video will be of a poor quality when viewed on a TV. Perform a google search for ""videohelp bitrate calculator"" and click on the Videohelp bitrate calculator link. I use the calculator to figure out what bitrate I should capture in, according to the total time of all the programs I want to put on DVD. Below 7 Mb/s seems to be the cutoff point where more artifacts start to be seen during playback, but it's ultimately a personal choice based upon how you want to archive your movies.

After capturing this longer movie, I found the unit to be unresponsive and the bottom was extremely hot. Now, whenever I operate it, I point a small fan at it, and this seems to keep it cool and running well. But keeping the unit cool shouldn't be the user's responsibility, so it loses points for temperature.

While this device works well if the input video has a stable picture, a few of my tapes are of lower quality and have a lot of garbage in the picture from generational loss (being copied several times). I tried capturing one of these tapes, which was of a TV show from 1993, and the DVD Xpress did not handle it very well. The result had a lot of flickering images and was ultimately unsatisfactory. I am disappointed with this.

On the other hand, I have a tape that was recorded from TV in 1988. It is the master copy, so there is no generational loss. DVD Xpress was able to capture it just fine.

Not once during any of my captures did audio & video get out of sync, so credit where credit's due to ADS Tech for that.

After a few days of experimenting with this capture device, I definitely want to keep it. I look forward to finally being able to clean out my VHS closet.

My recommendations to other buyers: Understand your source, and you won't be disappointed. There is no way you can make your 10-20 year old tapes look pristine again. But if the video signal is strong and stable, the DVD Xpress should be able to capture it with no problems",Michael the City-dwelling Hermit,100

It is the most commonly asked question from digital camera enthusiast but usually the question that is the most difficult to get a straight answer about.  Well, considering I worked in the memory industry for over 7 years I can help clarify this perplexing question and do so unbiased as I have since changed industries.  

The Lexar Media 1GB SD Card SD1GB -32-231, like most 1000MB cards, will store on average 1137 pictures when used with a 2 megapixel camera, 853 images when used with a 3 megapixel camera,  512 pictures when used with a 4 megapixel camera, 409 images when used with a 5 megapixel camera, and 320 pictures when used with a 6 megapixel camera.  These numbers are based off the assumption that you are going to shoot your images at the highest quality JPEG setting available for the camera and understand that they are estimates and may be off by as much as 10 percent due to numerous factors including the complexity of the scene being shot and the compression algorithm used by your specific camera.

One last thing to consider when buying a 1000MB card.  Do not necessarily choose the least expensive card available.  A 1000MB card should be an investment.  You need to consider quality, reliability, and speed with a card of this capacity.  Worse case scenario would be you taking this card (and only this card) on vacation with you overseas and for some reason it gets corrupted.  Then what do you do?  Purchasing a high capacity card changes the game a little, just be mindful of that before you hit the buy button.

46,"B0009O5MWI:just_amazing_!!!!!____:ernest_o._kanu_""ernest""",Philips HTS3400D/37 Home Theater System with DVD Player: Electronics,Just Amazing !!!!!,"The first time I saw this piece was at Wal-mart. I had listened to Sony,Philips, JVC, Panasonic, RCA in that order, the difference was instantly clear. Then I went back to listen to the Philips again and the difference was clear.I recommend that first time buyers should go to a store with several brands on display that they could listen to. I made up my mind that if  I wanted a home theater in a box (HTIB)package it will be the Philips brand.This was about 10 months ago. Each time I stopped by the electronic section of any store I would check it out. Finally, I decided to buy one. Next thing was to read expert reviews and consumer reviews. Most reviews rated it high. However, I was concerned about the hissing sound some consumers had experienced.I still went ahead to buy one at Fred Meyer for $179:00 on sale, if I did not like it, I will return it, I reasoned. I bought the black colored piece. Costco and Radioshack had it on sale for the same price but Fred Meyer is closer to my home. 
Since adding this piece to our family room, the audio effects in our family room is certainly more welcoming, warmer , richer and entertaining than before.
 I will address the concerns of a few reviews here.
1. Hissing sound: I found none, but discovered that if the audio OUT on your TV has one jacket like mine, instead of two or three jackets, then you need to get an extension RCA jacket that will split your one outlet to two or three OUT jackets with the apporpriate color codes (white, red (for two jackets) and yellow for the third jacket) to match the audio IN jacket (white and red) of the DVD player, otherwise you will get either a humming or hissing sound. Please note that the key here is to have the color codes on your TV audio OUT,to match the color codes on your Philips DVD  audio IN otherwise you will get a humming or hissing sound.

2. DVD player jumping disc: You are using a defective disc. solution: change your disc.

3. Back speakers not working: They will not work if you do not use the remote control to adjust the surround and sound buttons to the appropriate mode e.g. movie , stereo etc. Sometimes, some movies are not recorded to produce surround sound effect, so change the TV channel or your DVD disc.

4. Speaker wires not long enough:Some consumers had enough length, mine were too short for our large family room (too large for me to bother to measure). One reviewer was able to use banana plugs to make the adaptation,I could not. So I returned the banana plugs, I bought from Home depot. Instead, I  bought some digital extension cables. They come in different sizes 14G,16G,18G,20G etc. The smaller the size number, the thicker the cable, the better, to avoid loss of digital signals. I bought size 14G. The risk with attaching extension cables is that since you will have to cut into the original cables that come with the equipment you can not return your equipment to the store nor sell it at ebay for a good price if you wanted to,since it will be considered tampered with. But be reassured you will not need to dispose of this equipment once you have it properly set up.If you decide to use additional extension cable/wire, cut the orginal wire at about 6 inches from the speakers. Attach your extention cable to this cut end and run the attached extension cable from your speaker location to where your equipment is.Then attach the other end of your extension cable to the other end of the original cable, so you can still use the proprietary speaker plugs that came with your equipment to attach to the back of the set.This method makes it cosmetically suitable to have one cable (i.e. the extension) run through your entire room and at the same time use the the proprietary plugs attached to the orginal cable at the other end with your equipment, which by the way is the only plug that fits into the jackets at the back of the DVD player/receiver.REMEMBER to tape over all exposed wires/cables with nonconductive electric tape. Normally, comes in black.
Caution: you need to buy enough length of extension cable though, they come in 25ft, 50ft and 100ft length. Having a large room I bought three 50 feet cables to do the job satisfactorily.The cost for each 50 ft cable was $19:00.



5. Wall mountings:The enclosed wall mountings are fixed. You can not rotate the position of your speakers once mounted. For less than $15:00 at Wal-mart , I bought a set of 5 speakers wall mounts that I can rotate from side to side or move up and down to a suitable head angle.

Speaking of the sound production, it is clear, crisp and true theater realism. The sonics can not be described justily unless you hear it for your self.Do your self a favor and buy one.

But for the proprietary plugs that make it difficult to consider using extension cables , I would have given it 5 stars. Philips should make the plugs universally adaptable, so consumers wil not have second thoughts about adding extension cables, if they needed to. Better still, Philips could add more length to the cables or make provisions for one to order fitting extension cables through them so you do not have to cut into the original cables.","Ernest O.

But for those of us who've not yet shelled out a few hundred dollars for the latest iPod (I think the latest version is down to a quantum-level size device), this is a solid player for that purpose.  And the cassette player/recorder is also handy if you want to tape from your MP3 CD (or any CD, or the radio) for the benefit of those you may know who still haven't gone to CD yet (there are still a few of those out there as well).  Generally, this is a good product, though there are a couple of drawbacks.

First, the remote control apparently does not work when the boombox is running purely on batteries.  This seems kind of silly given that remotes aren't exactly power hogs.  Now, this could simply be a quirk of mine, and may not be a feature of the product overall, but I really didn't feel like dealing with the hassle of shipping it back and getting another one, so I've decided to live with this (it's not often it'll be on pure battery mode).

The other minor complaint is that it's not possible to fast-forward within an MP3 track when playing an MP3 CD (regular CD's can fastforward within a track).  Not sure why it doesn't, since every other MP3 CD player I've come across does (discman, car MP3 CD player, etc.), but it's not enough of a complaint to discourage picking one up in my view.

The sound equalizer is very minimal, but truthfully I wasn't picking this up so that everything would sound like a stadium rock concert to a jazz club to a concert hall, and things in-between.

The FM tuner has too much interference The FM is fine if you listen to a strong station but If you tune to a weaker station and your close to a downtown area you will hear 4 or 5 strong stations bleeding through the weaker ones. I`ve tried ajusting the coils but this model has no ajustments for FM only AM the AM has bleed too so if you try to pick up distant stations at night you may hear the strong station next to it. For example I live in Atlanta GA so the strongest AM signal is 750 WSB so if I try to tune into 780 WBBM at night I get 750 bleeding through I have had other Panasonic boomboxes that don`t have this trouble with AM.

85,B00009YUPS:amazingly_easy_and_dummy_proof:john_williams,ADS Tech DVD Express 2.0 (USBAV-701): Electronics,Amazingly easy and dummy proof,"I'm a little surprised at the average low rating this product has received from other users.  Currently I'm running an AMD64 3500+ with 1.5gig ram.  The software installed easily the first time with no problems and in no time I was recording my first transfer from a VHS player.  I'm very comfortable using Adobe Premiere Elements 2.0 so that's what I decided to use instead of the bundled software.

I've created over 25 DVD's successfully and tonight I decided to give the ""Direct to disk"" a try.  I recorded directly from the video source to the DVD and just like that, I had a single session recording that looked beautiful during playback on my DVD player.

I have nothing but praise for the ease of use and dependability of version 3.7.  I have used other hardware packages on lesser systems and yes, there were many problems.  But after upgrading to something with more power like the AMD64 with 1.5gig ram...well...it was a whole new ballgame.  Everything worked as advertised.  Just as it should",John Williams,0

Others tip over easily, or they hold only books of a limited size, or they are large, heavy, bulky, and therefore absurdly expensive, etc...

This is light, yet sturdy. Hint: I included a few large metal clips, the ones with long silver grasps that flip over and hold the pages in place. With the clips, this bookholder works excellently well.

In addition, it is also preforated to fit into any three-ring binder. The manufacturer thought of everything on this one. I keep one in the car for when I read in restaurants, another at home, and still a third on my office desk","He who knows, knows. ""Let Him Teach You""",100

I was skeptical when I read the other reviews and I stuck with Memorex, but I have seen the light now. For a year I was very successful with the DVD+R Memorex disks.  In the 25 pack spindles I would buy, they would all work....so in Aug '04 I bought 2 25 packs at Circuit City (a mistake?).   That appears to have been a waste of money.  I just tried to burn a copy of something and I ended up trashing 4 disks in a row.  I was  convincing myself it was my hardware or program or something else.  Then I remembered someone had given me a blank Sony DVD-R disk, so I thought what the heck, let me try that one.    Into the SONY drive it went and it copied without a hitch.   That was the final straw for my Memorex loyalty.  Out of a pack of 25, I have about 10 left, but have had to trash 6 of the 15 I used. Not a good success ratio.  Bye Memorex",Jadecat,83

However, I had my doubts so I ordered it anyway and it's great.  No buzzing noise on mine at all.  I have an apartment and didn't really want to spend a whole lot of coin on a major system that I couldn't really use anyway because of noise restrictions.  This system is nice and clear and gives me the Home Theater Experience I was looking for.  They give you plenty of wire to run along the edge of a room and still have enough slack to hang the rear speakers up behind the couch on the wall.  Granted the speaker wire isn't all that thick, and has a proprietary male/female connector into the unit which would make upgrading to monster cable a pain.  It still sounds great and for under $200 bucks why would you care anyway.",A. Manezes,100
