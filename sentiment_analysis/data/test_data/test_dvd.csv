Many have gone on to star in movies that made lots of money, but without the awards and critical recognition of the LOTR movies.  Not so with Viggo Mortensen.  Right after LOTR he followed with this awesome adventure story by Disney.  Coming out the summer after Pirates of the Caribbean, this was supposed to be Disney's next big live-action, summer adventure hit.  Unfortunately, it flopped at the box office.  Luckily, it has made a comeback on the DVD market, which is where this reviewer saw it.  All in all, it is a great movie, and probably one of the best live-action movies Disney has produced in a long while; judging from its ratings here on amazon and on imdb.com.  

In short, this movie is about Frank Hopkins, half-white, half-native american horserider who is mired in middle-age guilt and self remorse.  Along comes an opportunity for a change in scenery - a trip to the Arabian desert for a race.  Frank takes the challenge with his horse Hidalgo and of they go.  The race across the Arabian desert tests both rider and horse, and introduces them to a cast of characters that only an accomplished movie studio like Disney could have created.  We have the strong-willed girl full of innocence and inner strength, a fierce father and tribe leader who suffers no insults to his honor or intelligence, a backstabbing fellow racer who smiles until the final death, a seductive beauty willing to win at any costs, an arrogant prince with no moral bounds, etc, etc...  It all reminds our protagonist of his days in Montana!  During the course of the race, which Frank and Hidalgo win of course; both of them are tested to the limit.  The movie ends on a triumphal note for both.  The rider redeems his guilt by freeing Hidalgo from human ownership forever, and freeing his consciensce of past betrayals.

The soundtrack is awesome, the cinematography is great, the dialogue is realistic, and for once, a movie set in a foreign land that actually uses actors from that area speaking the language of that area!  My compliments to Disney and the cast and crew of this movie.  I highly recommend it to all audiences from teenagers on up",Newton Ooi,100

The spaghetti scene in Lady and the Tramp. Bambi's mother in that movie, or the pink elephant scene in Dumbo are examples of scenes that are just as memorable as the films. So it's odd that so many of Alice's scenes are pop culture even when it didn't have the warmest welcome on release. Granted we're not talking Disney's masterpiece level but still, it's quite a quirky movie.

Alice is receiving lessons when she sees the reflection of a rabbit in the water. She follows it and stumbles down a long hole and enters the world of Wonderland. She ends up seeing a long list of quirky situations including Tweedledee and Tweedledum, the Mad Hatter, Queen of Hearts, talking flowers and the White Rabbit.

Even though it's a film unto itself, many of its scenes are referenced in other films are they're just pop culture iconic scenes. And of course the Matrix brought it back by using the rabbit hole and white rabbit imagery. The film however didn't get the biggest response as people were confused by it and found it odd. It's even written Walt himself apologized for it although it became popular after it was on a television show edited down.

This is probably the most atypical film Disney's released, although other films such as Emperor's New Groove or Atlantis are quite different. While those 2 were pretty devoid of characters breaking out into song, Alice has a bunch of songs. The imagery of course is odd as we get walking pencils, talking flowers, tears turning into raging waters and a cat who has a habit of disappearing. You can obviously tell why critics couldn't understand it. It's still cited as one of Disney's more better ""smart"" films such as Fantasia.

You should check it out? Of course but word of caution: by no means are you going to see a quintessential Disney classic but still you'll probably like it and enjoy it...probably","Cloud ""...""",100

Some took the story as horror rather than a childhood fantasy.  Others consider Alice's journey as a trip into or through insanity.  For better or worse, Disney did capture many of these elements, and the same criticisms of the books that form the basis of this film apply to the film.  However, there are also those who loved the books and loved the film.  Normally I recommend Disney classis without reservations.  In the case of this movie, I will keep a couple of provisos.

Alice is a young girl bored by her lessons.  As the length of the lessons grows, Alice soon drifts off, until a white rabbit passes by, muttering to himself that he is late.  Alice follows the white rabbit and falls into a rabbit hole that seems to fall forever.  Luckily for Alice her dress opens out into a kind of parachute and slows her descent.
Once at the bottom of the hole, Alice discovers a door into which she is unable to pass because the door is too small.  However, there is a vial labeled ""drink me"" that Alice discovers makes her small enough to go through the door.

Alice is soon on her way into a series of surreal adventures that are in the best tradition of adult animation.  Indeed, Alice might have worked better as an adult story given the number of references to adult vices and frailties throughout the film.  Even the fundamental basis of Alice's journey through Wonderland owes as much to psychological references as it does childhood fantasies.  The ending of Alice's journey in particular is quite frightening, especially to younger children, embodying all that can be horrible in nightmares.  I remember seeing ""Alice in Wonderland"" as a child, and I remember I thought the ending was scary, and I was relieved when Alice was able to escape back to the normal world.

Given that this film is well over fifty years old, I was disturbed by the smoking caterpillar, if for no other reason than our current knowledge of what smoking does.  The smoke did negatively affect Alice as it made her cough.  Perhaps there is an object lesson for children here.  While some consider many of the references to allude to drugs, I think that is a modern interpretation.  I think eating or drinking items to get larger or smaller was merely a convenient plot device for the author rather than an allegory for drug use.  Remember that this story was first published in 1869.

I believe this film is excessively criticized by those who do not like its style and the post-era associations with negative elements that were never intended by the original author and by Disney.

For all these provisos, this film is excellent.  It matches ""Fantasia"" in its surreal visions, and the construct and tying together of the individual stories is superb.  The animation is marvelous as well, readily illustrating the vision of Alice's journey.

This movie is one of those rare Disney films that I am unable to recommend to all viewers.  Whether you will enjoy this film is strictly a matter of personal taste.  If you enjoy animation oriented toward adults, then you may find this animation a treat.  If you are open-minded about the story and consider when the story was written and animated, you may also find that you enjoy it.  I do recommend this movie for slightly older children, perhaps 8 and above, considering some of the disturbing images.  Good luck!","Lonnie E. Holder ""The Review's the Thing""",58

The humor in this film alternates between exceedingly subtle and understated to borderline farce in a worthy successor of Rob Reiner's THIS IS SPINAL TAP, in which Christopher Guest costarred, and predecessor to Guest's later masterpieces BEST IN SHOW and A MIGHTY WIND.  Reiner in his film created the mockumentary comedy genre, in which characters largely ad libbed their parts while everything was filmed as if it were a documentary.  Guest has in three films now masterfully emulated Reiner's style, assembling a group of actors he prefers to use over and again.  Almost all of the central actors have appeared in two or more of these films and several in all three.

Unless one prefers dumbed-down slapstick, this is comedy just about as funny as it comes.  The first time I saw it I don't think I really caught on until the scene where Blaine, Missouri's (the film was actually filmed in Texas) town historian recounted how Blaine was founded after wagon train leader Blaine Fabin mistakenly told the settlers that they were in California near the Pacific when in fact they were in Missouri.  

The plot is rather simple.  In honor of the 150th anniversary of Blaine's inadvertent founding, a day of celebration is being held that will be capped by a locally written and produced musical revue.  Corky St. Clair, an obviously gay theater person who has fled New York for the small town, takes on the challenge of directing.  The bulk of the movie consists of auditions, rehearsals, and the final performance of the musical.  The title stems from the hope that a Mr. Guffman of a New York theatrical company will be in attendance.  

This film was literally made up as they went along.  My understanding is that they ended up with dozens of hours of footage out of which Guest had to craft a final film.  While move films are refined in the editing phase, this one is unique for being created at that stage.  Because most of the dialogue is made up as the cameras roll, a film like this takes a special cast of actors.  Veterans of improv like Catherine O'Hara and Eugene Levy and stand ups such as Fred Willard are to be expected, but what is so great is how people you wouldn't automatically think would excel in the form, such as the always delightful Parker Posey, do so.  By way of trivia, the part of the play's narrator is played by Lewis Arquette, son of Cliff Arquette and father of all those other Arquettes, including Rosanna, Patricia, and David.  And I'm sure all ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT fans will love the UFO expert, played by none other than Tobias himself, David Cross (famed himself for ad libbing many of his lines on that show).

One of the best jokes in the movie occurs in a ""Three Months Later"" coda that finds out where the principal performers in the musical have ended up.  Corky is back in New York, hoping for tryouts (perhaps as Henry Higgins in a revival of MY FAIR LADY).  The joke comes when we find out he is running a Hollywood memorabilia store, where one of the hottest items is a MY DINNER WITH ANDRE action figure set.  For those who haven't seen the film, the only thing that happens in the entirety of the movie is Wallace and Andre talk while seated in a restaurant.

I've learned the hard way that this and Guest's other films aren't for everybody.  Not everyone seems to ""get"" them.  This astonishes me since I find these films funnier than anything else coming out of Hollywood these days.  But for whatever reason, so people are not capacitated for some reason to enjoy them.  But for those who are, these films are priceless gems",Robert W. Moore,71

Nothing wrong with that, but be aware that the reviews you'll read here are from a VERY skewed sample of movie fans. I love good comedy, and so does my wife, but both of us found this movie terminally dull. It's basically a one-joke movie -- the joke being that the people in it (the characters, not the actors) are totally untalented, but also totally oblivious to that fact. So they just keep on doing their unfunny bits. 

""Waiting for Guffman"" does not appear on the American Film Institute's list of 100 Funniest Movies. Nor is it on the IMDB list of 50 Top Comedies, as rated by thousands of movie fans. So anyone who tells you this movie is the ""funniest movie ever"" or ""hilarious"" is definitely out of the mainstream.

I'll give Guest and his usual crew credit for doing something a bit off the beaten path. The improv/mockumentary format has the potential to be funny, but in this mess of a movie, it doesn't work very well. There are some funny bits (David Cross is always a stitch) but too much of it just falls flat. It feels like something that would have worked on SNL as a 10-minute sketch, but as a full-length movie it just CRAWLS. 

OK, I've said my piece -- and I'm sure that I'll get lots of ""not helpful"" ratings from the movie's rabid fans who make up the majority of the folks that will check out this title. But if you're not a fan of slow, dry, improvisational movies, be warned: you won't find ""Waiting for Guffman"" very amusing",David F. Nolan,22

He's better looking than all the girls in it too--including the phony poser lesbian with the fabulous midriff when Alyssa dumps her.  I fast forwarded through this after the first half, pausing occasionally to hear dialogue that made Dumb and Dumber look like  Hemingway.  

In summation, if you like this movie, you have been dumbed down by the evil Hollywood machine, and I suggest you check out good foreign films like A Good Marriage and beautiful scandals like Valmont immediately.

I usually don't write reviews, simple because most of the kid's fitness programs I've seen aren't worth the time to write about. But, Kick to Get Fit Jr. - For Kids, is completely different than anything I've ever seen. The film quality was very good, and the instructor did such a great job interacting with the kids, he's truly a natural with kids. One of the things I liked best about this program was the tempo  flow, and the way the instructor just seemed to flow with the program. What I mean is, it didn't appear that he had  memorized a script (of what to say) or that he was reading word for word from a script, he just went with the flow. And, any one of us who has ever worked with kids before knows that you have to be natural with kids in order to make it fun, anything less than that will effect the quality of what you're doing. - Now, don't get me wrong, this program was well rehearsed  extremely well put together, but the instructor  kids were truly going with the flow  having fun. - Which is definitely more appealing to the kids watching the program. - Kids enjoy watching kids having fun, and if the kids on the program are having fun, then the kids watching want to participate so that they can have just as much fun. It doesn't get much simpler than this, unfortunately most programs have no understanding of this concept and fall way short.

Although this was John's first book, it wasn't successful until one of more of his other books became successful. After the popularity of other books such as the firm this book hit the best sellers list. Then comes the subject of making this book into a movie. When John Grisham was foirst approached about turning it into a movie, he was somewhat reluctant because he felt the subject matter was to sensitive. He felt that without his input, the movie could not reflect what Grisham was trying to present in the book. After several of John Grisham's books were made into movies and were successful, I knew it was only a matter of time before ""A Time To Kill"" would be on the big screen. This movie is a great reflection of the book and maybe so because John Grisham had some influence over the production. The movie has an all star cast including Samuel L. Jackson, Matthew McConaughey, and Kevin Spacey. This movie is one of the best books turned into movies of the last thirty years. This DVD should be apart of everyone's movie collection. As this book will surely be a literary classic for hundreds of years to come, the movie will also be.",James Shannon Bussey,100

I love the interviews with Barbara, Larry and Bill Daily.

Besides containing a stellar cast (Matthew McConaughey, Sandra Bullock, Sammuel L. Jackson, Oliver Platt, DOnald AND Keifer Sutherland, Kevin Spacey) You get the idea. Is there a cast member that ISN't a biggie? The casting is Genious, and the acting incredible. It's suspenseful, deep, VERY emotional.. slightly dark.. it's the perfect movie. Even the rape scene is well done by being comfortably vague while still haunting you. 

     A Time to kill's plot is pretty simply explained.  In the deep south, a 10 year old black girl is raped by two wite rednecks, who almost kill her. A young white lawyer and father (Matthew McConaughey as Jake Brigance) is sickened at the news, and doesn't quite know what to think when the little girl's father (Sammuel L. Jackson as Carl Lee Hailey) pays him a visit and asks if he'd ""help him if he were in a tight spot"".  The next day as the two redneck/monsters are being led up the stairs of the courthouse to their arraignment, Carl Lee Hailey pops out of a storage clauset with a machine gun and blows away the two young men that raped his daugher. 
    Jake Brigance agrees to defend Hailey as his murder trial begins. The insanity plea is used to ""give the jury an excuse to aquit"" But in my opinion, I think it was quite legitimate. What father WOULDN't be driven insane under the circumstances?  the rest of the movie is Carl Lee Hailey's trial and the surrounding Drama as KKK violence emerges led by Kiefer Sutherland, and Jake's life and home are in danger, his relationship with his wife strained, and his career are seriously on the line in what seems to be a loosing battle.  
      My favorite scene? It might come as a surprise, but my favorite scene is when the Prosecution calls to the stand the policeman who was leading the two rednecks up the stairs to their trial. He was caught in the knee by a stray bullet, and now has half a leg.  After the prosecution use the witness to incite rage against Carl Lee, and establish unerring identity of the shooter, The Defence asks him two questions. 
""Do you think Carl Lee intentionally shot you?"" 
""No"" 
""Do you think he should be sent to prision for what he did?""
""He did what I would have done.""
but it doesn't end there as the Policeman (remember he's missing a leg because of what Carl Lee Hailey Did) becomes very emotional and boldly confesses that if someone raped his little girl he would blow him away just like Carl Lee did. He starts screaming to the jury to ""turn him loose, He's a hero!""  I think this is one of the most emotion packed and well acted scenes (albeit there are many others too) (Great acting by Chris Cooper as the policeman) 

Anyway.. forgive if I rambled. I love this movie and if you like courtroom dramas... star studded casts.. John Grisham...suspense thrillers..just all around good movies.. You need to see this.","Shelly T, ""czarinaanya""",100

Although same in concept and scope than Bewitched, this shows superior cast and performances tower over Bewitched. I believe this show was much more funnier than Bewitched. Barbara Eden stars as Jeannie and Larry Hagman stars as Cap.(later Maj.) Anthony Nelson. And Bill Daily stars as Roger Healy, Maj. Nelsons best friend.  This dvd set covers the entire 1st season (30 episodes) of the series. Since this series 1st season was shot in black and white, this is the preference for me over the alternative colorized dvd set. As far as the video and audio go, the video looks fantastic. Episodes are clean and sharp with no compression. No dirt or scratches noticeable. Audio is in clean 2.0 mono sound. All episodes are complete and uncut. The pilot episode includes a audio commentary with Larry Hagman, Barbara Eden, and Bill Daily. It's nice and pleasant but not very informative. This is the main problem I have about this set. NO INFORMATION!! To me this keeps this set from getting 5 stars. The 4 dvds come in 2 seperate cases covering all 30 episodes. On the back of the cases you get episode #, title of each episode, and small description of each one. I think there should be more info than this, so I had hoped when I played the dvds, got to the main menu, and selected an episode, I would get a small amount of trivia, some more details such as  production date, 1st broadcast date, and cast listing with special guest stars. No such luck. I had hoped for much more info about each episode. You get a 14 minute featurette with new interviews with Sidney Sheldon, Larry Hagmen, Barbara Eden, and Bill Daily, which is a nice (but short) special feature. It's nice to see them together and still very good friends. They were the backbone of this great show (along with the late Hayden Roarke). Hayden Roarke was wonderful as Dr. Alfred Bellows. I would have loved for him to have been there too. In closing this is still a great set to have, and I intend to have all 5 seasons of this great show.

Rated ""R"" for language and violent content (including a scene dipicting the rape of a ten year old girl), the film contains not only strong content but strong performances from a number of ""A"" list stars.  

Samuel L. Jackson plays Carl Lee Hailey, the father of the raped girl who takes out his revenge against the rapists by shooting them in cold blood as they are being escorted to their arraignment.  Young and inexperienced local attorney, Jake Brigance (played by Matthew McConaughey in one of his first major roles) agrees to defend Carl Lee against the smarmey District Attroney Rufus Buckley (played by Kevin Spacey).  Brigance is helped with the case by the unlikely trio of Sandra Bullock (playing a well-to-do law student), Oliver Platt (a morally devoid divorce attorney) and Donald Sutherland (a drunken disbarred lawyer who gave Brigance his first job).  As the plot builds, the community begins to takes sides in the case.  The KKK is called in to intimidate Carl Lee's defense team and the NAACP enters to counteract the Klan's actions.

In some reviews, the film is panned as being poorly written and unbelieveable.  This reviewer found the film fairly well done and true to the book.  Without revealing any key plot details, let me suffice to say that the film is true to the novel and portrays the Deep South in a accurate way.

Thomas Howell,Stevan Rimkus,Jerry Hardin,Frank Collison,Joe Johnston",Classic film making on a grand scale.  A truly epic film.,"Hidalgo is based upon a true story, so it's no wonder it's thrilling, truth being stranger than fiction and all.  Although it's highly doubtful that everything in the movie actually happened, Frank Hopkins was indeed a real life cowboy, master horseman and rider and he did participate in the great Bedouin horse race of the Middle East known as the ""Ocean of Fire"" in the 1890's.

This wonderfully stylized and lovingly crafted film clocks in at over two hours, yet never bores and your interest should never waver.  The international cast is terrific, led by Viggo Mortensen in a low-key, subtle performance which brings depth and a real sense of nobility to the notion of a ""cowboy'.  We've seen loads of silver screen gun slingers, bandits and marshals from icons like the swaggering John Wayne to the laconic Clint Eastwood, but with Viggo's Frank Hopkins, we may now be witness to one of the most balanced and interesting portrayals of an authentic cowpoke.  And it's all the more interesting because Frank Hopkins isn't all cowboy - half of him is Native American.  This internal duality and cultural division brings character shadings and a unique sense of perspective to Hopkins.

Balancing the tensions of Native Americans with the US Government of the time, the film explores Frank Hopkin's journey between two worlds - that of a half Native American with loyal ties to his tribe and his jobs as a pony express rider and performer in Wild Bill Hickcock's show, all while having to live in the White Man's world.  When he's invited to participate in the Bedouin Race, Frank soon discovers there's a whole other world out there bound by similar dogmatic traditions, where women must hide their faces behind veils, much like he's chosen to hide his native ancestry to enable him to live an easier life.

Sweeping cinematography beautifully composes authentic locations and the stunt choreography infuses the race and the action set-ups with fun and authenticity.  Viggo must have definitely ""lived"" horses for the film, irregardless of his prior expertise with them.  He clearly is at the reigns of the horse most of the time and he's totally capable and always convincing.  Hidalgo the horse may qualify for his own sequel or a TV series.  This beautiful animal is more expressive than many human actors and it's just one of the many joys and reasons to give this film a chance.  Apparently lost by audiences in it's initial theatrical release, Hidalgo should be discovered by every movie lover.","W. N. Stape ""NJ Review Guy""",100

Yet GETTYSBURG does so.

This 1993 film, second in a civil war trilogy that begins with GODS AND GENERALS and concludes with LAST FULL MEASURE is worlds beyond its predecessor in cinematographic and dramatic prowess. To put it as succinctly as possible, this is a profoundly moving four hours of personalized history.

A film like this helps us to recall that we are not yet one hundred fifty years from southeastern Pennyslvania's momentary appearance as a killing field. In America's most costly war, this was its linchpin battle.

Tom Berenger and Martin Sheen turn in understated and powerful renderings of Confederate generals. Sheen's Robert E. Lee carries a mountain's weight of burden on his grieving shoulders even as he makes the decisions that will send still more Virginia gentlemen and Texas cowboys to their deaths. Jeff Daniels far outshines his earlier representation of Maine's Coronel Chamberlain, the six-times wounded college professor who would finish his working life as the president of Bowdoin College.

The panoramic battle scenes provided legions of Civil War reenactors with their glorious opportunity, one that - with the exception of a handful of volunteers who couldn't help grinning while they were being shot down - seized the day with remarkable poignance.

This one is for seeing again and again, remembering, and bowing one's head against the awful fact that nations are too often born in blood",David A. Baer,100

Thomas Howell,Stevan Rimkus,Jerry Hardin,Frank Collison,Joe Johnston",A Very Good Horse Race Movie,"In this movie that was supposedly inspired by the true story of Frank T. Hopkins, Viggo Mortenson does an excellent job of portraying the character.  Whether there actually was the race as described in the movie and whether Frank T. Hopkins actually existed is irrelevant.  What is important is that the movie is enjoyable and the race is nicely plotted.

Frank T. Hopkins is an accomplished rider.  He has been a dispatch rider for the U.S. Army, a Pony Express rider, and he has been in Buffalo Bill's Wild West show.  Frank appears well on his way to alcoholic oblivion when he is asked to race in the 3000 mile Ocean of Fire, a race that has been held for one thousand years.  After the obligatory refusal (all movies of this type must have the humble hero refuse to be a hero) he travels by sea to the Middle East.

A side note.  The movie begins with the infamous Wounded Knee massacre.  The memory of that horrific even supposedly haunts Frank.  I will discuss these distractions more later in this review.

This movie finally comes into its own when the Ocean of Fire race begins.  Several of the sponsors of the race have their own agendas for winning the race.  Numerous attempts are made to kill Frank during the race.  Of course, Frank manages to survive all these attempts.  He also manages to rescue a kidnapped princess, and to save his horse from spikes, big cats, and bullets, not to mention heat, thirst and hunger.  Nearly every part of the movie that deals with the race is quite good and entertaining.

The title of the movie comes from the mustang named Hidalgo.  Hidalgo has a lot of heart and a lot of character.  Hidalgo was smarter than many of the characters in this movie.  Sales of horses will go up as a result of this movie.

The only issue I had with this movie was the distractions.  I thought the Wounded Knee massacre, while a horrible incident and one worthy of a separate movie, to be a distraction from the race.  Even though Frank later saw his ancestors in a hallucination in the desert, we did not need the massacre to recognize who they were.  I also thought the release of the wild mustangs by Frank could have been handled more succinctly, though I admit that seeing mustangs running across the plains of the Midwest was inspiring.  Throwing in all the details about Jazira, the daughter of Sheikh Riyadh (played by the great Omar Sharif) were further distractions.  The result is a movie that is bloated in places and begins too slowly.

I thought Viggo Mortenson was great as Aragorn in the Lord of the Rings movies.  He does an equally good job as Frank T. Hopkins.  Enjoy the race; enjoy the rescue of the princess; fast forward through the rest.","Lonnie E. Holder ""The Review's the Thing""",77

I knew from the very beginning of the movie that there was no way I was going to be able to stay awake through the whole thing.  I was right; I fell asleep about fifteen minutes into it.  Recently, I was offered the chance to watch it again.  I thought, ""OK, I didn't see the whole thing, it might have gotten better, so I'll give it another chance."" ... Bad mistake.  This little tale about a horse race across a vast desert did nothing to hold my interest for very long.  Hidalgo is the name of the horse.  So what?  That's about as boring as this movie.  So why the 1-star markup? Cause the main character is played by Viggo Mortensen, of Aragorn fame in the smash movie series The Lord of the Rings- and I do like Viggo.  I did not, however, like this movie.  It's kind of fitting it should be set in a desert- cause that's exactly where this movie should be buried, never to bore another wave of audiences again.  If you find yourself overworked and in need of a nice long nap, watch Hidalgo; you'll be out in no time","Andrew Olson ""I'm confused.  Wait, maybe I'm not...""",0
49,"B00003CXA6:flawed,_but_effective:straitjacket_fits_""straitjacket_fits""","Gettysburg (Widescreen Edition): DVD: Tom Berenger,Martin Sheen","Flawed, but effective","Despite the chintzy, unconvincing facial hair (Jeff Daniels' being the exception); Martin Sheen's too-gentlemanly interpretation of Gen. Lee's accent (and his beard); obvious  saccharine soliloquies about the higher purpose for fighting the war; generalized (and largely inaccurate) interpretations of the underlying history of the war; and hopelessly, ridiculously, wildly off-the-mark attempts atNew England accents, the film still works.

I understand that to get a film produced and distributed, it is often necessary to have recognizable names in the cast.  But an unknown who looks more like General Lee than Martin Sheen would have been a better choice.  And C. Thomas Howell's performance--well, let's just say that his glued-on beard was more convincing than his acting.  Jeff Daniels, however, does an excellent job, in large part because he doesn't try to convince you he's from New England and consequently does not come off like Cliff from Cheers, using every stereotype associated with nasal 'r'-dropping.  Instead of focusing on the so-called nasality of  the NE accent (think of Sheen in The Missiles of Octobah), Daniels allows the viewer to suspend disbelief.  But then, here comes CT Howell again to slap you across the face and remind you that Sheen and Kevin Costner aren't the only actors who should have appeared as New Englanders in an Ed Wood production.

I think the story works because there's enough commitment to historical military fact to make it believable.  The battle scenes probably should have been more visually graphic to evoke the horror of the battle, but the movie makers either didn't have the budget for gore (maybe it was spent on the obviously fake beards) or decided to err on the side of forbearance.  If Gettysburg had been made 8-10 years later, it might have benefited from the newer style of violence-depiction, as in Saving Private Ryan, Thin Red Line, or Gladiator.  It falls a bit short of that, however.

Finally, it should be noted that the producers/director seem to be operating on a rather simplistic view of the war's historical underpinnings, opting to represent the northern point of view as one united behind the idea of freeing the slaves. Anyone who knows about the Boston busing riots of the 1970s will understand that not all of the north is steeped in racial generosity and brotherhood. Very few who fought on the side of the blue fought because they believed in the abolition of slavery.  They fought to preserve the Union, which is a very different concept.  Abolition of slavery happened to be the issue that forced the South's hand, but it was not the sole cause of the war.  The movie dumbs this down a bit, making the message more like what you'd find in a 5th-grade text book.

The battle at Gettysburg was certainly pivotal, but viewers should remember that it did not end the Civil War.  The north absolutely needed to win it, but Lee continued to cause the North fits for almost 2 years after Gettysburg.  C. Thomas Howell will continue to cause me fits every time I think of this movie.

Still and all, the film is very watchable.  And due credit should be given to the re-enactors, arguably the greatest source of credibility for the film","Straitjacket Fits ""Straitjacket Fits""",44

Interesting to note that Omar Sharif was in this modern-day movie and Dr. Zhivago. Several younger friends that saw this film told me they were very disappointed because, thanks to the previews, they thought it would be an action-packed adventure story such as ""The Mummy."" Well, it wasn't and it was way too slow for them.

Frankly, I thought the ""slow"" parts were the best and overall, thought the film had just the right amount of action, instead of overdoing it as the recent Mummy pictures did. Another big plus was the cinematography. This is a beautifully filmed movie, stunning in some parts. Another good point is the language: hardly a swear word.

On the negative side, there was the usual political correctness, a la Dances With Wolves in which viewers are reminded several times of the massacre at Wounded Knee and soldiers are portrayed as the bad guys. The horse race had some credibility problems, too, as ""Hidalgo"" came back from the dead not once but twice to race like Secretariat!

The series starts off well with two sisters going into the dress-making business and opening up their own successful shop. Season 2 ditches some of the old villains (the scheming relatives) and introduces a French designer and a banker as the antagonist/s of the season.

Again, as with the first series, I like the character Bea a bit more than I like Evie. Evie's antics don't really excite me that much. She seems the more selfish and inconsiderate of the two. I also don't find myself enraptured by the Jack/Bea romance. While I enjoy both characters individually, I see Bea as too independent to settle down and become the perfect wife. Also, I don't really care that much about the film industry, so watching Jack 'on the job' doesn't hold that much appeal.

Only now, two years after its release is this fantastic action/adventure film finding on DVD the adoring audience it so richly deserves. I was initially confused by this movies unexpected lack of acceptance by the public, however after pondering the complexities of this failure for some time I have come to the following conclusion. It was all Aragorn's fault. Yes, that's correct, it was Aragorn's fault. Here are the reasons why I believe this to be true.

`Hidalgo' was Viggo Mortensen's first film following his co-starring role in the massive and unbelievably successful three film production of `The Lord of the Rings.' His long matted hair, scruffy beard and moustache along with those distant, piercing eyes have been forever imprinted into the collective unconscious of every moviegoer. The shock of seeing Viggo as Frank T. Hopkins, American cowboy in a funny hat and bandana, much shorter cropped hair, clean shaven and riding on a little spotted mustang was simply too much for 'the faithful' to handle. Viggo's fan base simply wasn't ready to give up the image of the King of Middle-Earth yet. Unable to accept the new look, people stayed away from the theaters thus turning Disney's expected big drawing card into a major strategic error. To put it plan and simple, `Hidalgo' came out too soon.

If you're finally willing to move beyond the Aragorn persona and see a fast moving, well acted, beautifully shot film with a inspiring story to tell I invite you to give `Hidalgo' a viewing. Viggo is perfect as the half Indian, half white man who rides the little Pinto that never gives up and Omar Sharif delivers his best performance since `Lawrence of Arabia'. He's alert, witty and absolutely delightful as the sometimes harsh, sometimes whimsical Sheikh Riyadh who likes to sit in his tent and read tales of the American Wild West. It's obvious he really enjoyed playing this part. Also excellent performances by Zuleikha Robinson as Jazira, Adoni Maropis as Sakr and a whole cast of exotic, fascinating characters participating in the torturous 3,000 mile desert horse race across the ""Ocean of Fire"".

The reporting of an act of violence by an African American father whose daughter had been kidnapped, brutally beaten, raped, and further debased brings together a rookie lawyer whose involvement with the father during the prolonged trial results in a suggestion that there may be hope for harmony, even on a small scale, if the racial lines can be erased or even blurred a bit.

Matthew McConaughey is the rookie white lawyer, Ashley Judd his wife, Samuel Jackson the father, Sandra Bullock the bright wannabe lawyer who assists McConaughey, Kevin Spacey the brilliant but slimy lawyer opposing McConaughey, Oliver Platt as McConaughey's sidekick, Donald Sutherland as the disbarred drunk of a lawyer who cleans up his act to help McConaughey find the truth justice knows, Patrick McGoohan as the implacable judge, and Kiefer Sutherland as the KKK redneck representing all the evil of the little southern town. It is a fine cast and Schumacher moves them naturally between their lives in the town and the interior of the courtroom with great facility.  

Perhaps this will never be considered as one of the 'Great Movies', but is certainly pleads the case for understanding and for putting an end to the evils of racial bias. Recommended.  Grady Harp, January 0",Grady Harp,93

I would feel confident in saying that many of us have had to deal with a colleague who thinks they are wonderful . I don't mind that so much . For me , the problem comes when those types are put in charge of a group of people .

This film can be seen as a comedy or as a good example of putting together a group of people who are more than a little self-centred . You will see the psychological game playing going on . It is a film for anyone who has ever been involved with amateur dramatics , or amateur anything .

What I grasped about The Village, aside from embracing a story I liked for itself, and for its ending which I didn't see coming, was a message of optimism that said it is possible for people to escape the boundaries and rules of an oppressive time and place, and recreate reality to suit their preferences. Think about that for a minute. People go scatterbrained trying to elude the dictates of our culture today, for instance, with its violence, its corporate intrusions, its governmental omnipresence, and here we saw a successful  experiment in utopian existence set in 1890, and I found that wonderful. I also loved the scenery, the muted color schemes, the attention to period detail and to the agrarian life. The performances of Bryce Dallas Howard, Joachim Phoenix, and William Hurt were also highly underrated. Never has a stretch of bare woods surrounding a meadow looked so foreboding. Never has the monster in the fairy tale been so close at hand. I liked The Village from the first day I saw it, and continue to think well of it even now",Ellie Reasoner,0

I have seen this video in the #1 spot for quite a while, but because it was priced a little higher than some of the other videos, I thought I would save a few dollars  try them instead. - BIG MISTAKE!!!

If you love horses, adventure, beautiful scenery and a film about the spirit of man and his horse, then please do see it.

And the directing drove me crazy, especially since M. Night...insists on filming group scenes as is he was just passing through, or following them without ever bothering with close-ups. These scenes make me feel like they were done by an amateur filmmaker with a his first video camera.   If you like the back of William Hurt's head, you'll get plenty of it in this film, the camera seems to avoid his face like the plague; which is too bad, since when he finally has a good speech, we are deprived of the anger I imagine was in his eyes.

The worst movie of this genre.,"Incredible does describe this movie- incredibly bad! This movie doesn't know what it wants to be. At times one can see attempts to recreate and milk the genuine rage and drama of ""Mississippi Burning"" or the anger and impunity of ""Ghosts of Mississippi"", or a hybrid of those and bits and pieces of other movies of this genre. At other times it looks like its just trying to draw from the sex appeal and cheesy interaction of 2 of its main actors, Matthew McConaughey and Sandra Bullock. As a result this movie picks up the rear in that genre's list of movies for lack of originality, and the scattered hodge podge statements it tries to make. Some of my favorite actors are wasted, either by being given cliched dialogue, over acting, or being put there merely for their brand name with no script to support their presence. If this script is considered a great adaptation of a great book, then I have no interest in reading the book. I'm sure the idea and the premise looked good on paper. But the direction doesn't guide the story with any coherence or identity of its own.  Bullock is mere cheesecake and is unbelievable in her role, proving she's only worthy of b-grade ""Miss Congeniality"" type crud.  McConaughey over acts so much (as can be said for Keifer Sutherland and others) that it can be said he balances out the under acting of Patrick McGoohan, Kevin Spacey and Donald Sutherland. Samuel L. Jackson should be ashamed of himself of not only his worst performance ever, but also easily his worst choice of movies to participate in.  Even the extras in this movie are horrible. Enough can't be said about the terrible direction in this movie, equating elongated facial shots with drama to a fault, making Sergio Leone westerns look much more authentic by comparison. This is not ""a powerful film."" It's a powerful attempt at using a big name cast, a brand name book and a capable director to use material that they know would easily jerk the emotions of its audience, and in doing that they resort to all the cliches of this genre scattering the story line in so many directions, culminating in an over the top, pleading hunk of cheese summation scene by McConaughey that wouldn't hold water in any real court of justice. Maybe people claim greatness to this movie out of guilt, or because they haven't seen quality comparisons and classics like ""Mississippis Burning,"" that has both a great script and fabulous acting. I don't know. All I know is it tugs from so many hokey directions it takes the final scene to remind everyone how it started. Among the top of my most over rated movies","Benito Vasquez ""Benji""",33

The story is a brutally honest one about racism in Mississippi in the year 1995.  A young black girl, ten years old, is raped and beaten by two white red-necks and when the young girls father (Samuel L. Jackson) takes revenge into his own hands and murders the two men resposible he's arrested and a trial is held.  The film revolves around this mans lawyer mostly, Jake (McConaughey) as his family and practice is placed under fire by a newly reformed KKK as his home is scortched and his partners are harassed and his wife and child are forced to leave town for their safty.  The film calls into account morality over law...whats right and wrong isn't always black and white and not so easily determined.  Acting on all fronts is strong, but it's Jackson who proves to be the light in this film as his tortured father suffers with every breath as he recounts what his baby went through.

The world moves for love. It kneels before it in awe.""","Alright, Im sure you already know what its about, if not, then just read above, because im here, trying to tell you why you should watch it.


I know, Ill get this out of the way fast. Just watch this movie for what it is, not what you want it to be! People argue that its not scary, or that the twist ending was horrible. Its not a horror movie, its not suposed to scare you. Its a love story. And listen to this: the twist ending?, its not suposed to be a surprise, its suposed form this whole movie, its suposed to define who these characters are, and what they are trying to do. This is a story of love, and of hope and innocence.

I just dont see how people who are fans of Shyamalans other movies can say ""I hated the ending, very predictable"" because, fans, you know what Shyamalan does, you know from seeing Signs that hes a deep writer, that he gives much more meaning than what you think its going to be.

So please, if the only thing thats holding you back from seeing this is the critics, or your friends, then see it anyway. Why would you let other peoples opinions rule what you like, or dont like? Sure, many didnt like it, some didnt even understand it, but that doesnt mean you wont like it. You just have to try it out.

If you havent had the end ruined for you, thats even better, because you still have this whole movie to look forward to, and if you dont enjoy it, than fine, but atleast you can say yourself that you didnt like it. I know too many people who havent seen it because it got bad reviews.

If you enjoy a good love story, or even an art-sy type of suspence movie, then im sure you will enjoy it. But its not for everyone. Im sure, if you get bored easily, or if you dont have an imagination (this is a MUST HAVE for any Shyamalan film)

And then theres the soundtrack, which deserves 5 stars all by itself because its so magical. Shyamalan is one of the few who knows how to use music for film, who can make the music be a character in the movie. 

But before I leave, trust me, dont watch this thinking its a horror movie, because its not. Thats the worst mistake you could make aboiut this film",Jim,0

I used the word `document' on purpose because this movie is accurate to the point of being a documentary.  It was even filmed at the Gettysburg National Military Park.  When you see the fight for Little Round Top or Pickett's Charge, or another fight, you are seeing the events much as they happened where they happened.    

Thousands of civil war re-enactors play the everyday soldiers you see in the background and in the grand charges of this battle.  These amateur enthusiasts put their heart into this movie and it shows.     

As a high school history teacher, I was timing certain parts of the movie to show in class.  When I timed Pickett's Charge, I realized it is shown in real time.  Those Confederate soldiers charged into Union gunfire for 28 minutes and you see every moment in this movie.

I like the way they have the killer as an intelligent person. Someone who has a knowledge of what he is doing. And the way he leaves clues for the cops to follow.

Upon the opening scene of the movie, I was highly upset.  It was only after the movie had begun that I realized I didn't buy a porn.  C'mon!  Bone Collector!?  That was a clever little marketing ruse you did there Universal.  Nice one.  You won't get me again.

It's a psycho-sexual thriller, with Angelina Jolie hitting on a genius gimp who has a knack for riddles, nuts and bolts, and jigsaw puzzles.  This guy is so smart he could probably beat Ken Jennings in Jeopardy.  He even has an awesome, magical straw that controls one of those Tempur-pedic beds.  He can make the bed recline with a magic straw!!  Unfortunately, he didn't do the bowling ball and wine glass trick.

Together with the gimp and his incredible pull within the police force that he is no longer a member of, Jolie (who is transferred from to homicide because she used a dollar bill to measure something) begins to unscramble the riddle of corpses, clues, comic books, and ancient steam pipes, leading to a super-duper surprise hunky-dory ending in which everything is perfect, and butterflies land on retarded kids' heads.  Only, there are a few major plot-holes:
1)	There is no way that Jolie would have switched departments.
2)	There is no way that Washington would have had that much pull.
3)	There is no way the serial killer would have left all the clues when he could just go for his main target to begin with.
4)	The clues that are so cleverly figured out don't even lead to figuring out who the killer is.

Things learned from this movie: 
-Ed O'Neill is more versatile than the Al Bundy role.  
-Make sure to never get into a cap driven by other than an Arab guy.
-I hate the fact that Queen Latifah, a person as talented as a stick of butter, has somehow managed to squeeze into a small sliver of celebrity.  The fifteen minutes have been over for quite some time now.  Leave.

In the end it's a mediocre movie from which I expected more.  Given the combo of Washington and Jolie, there really should have been greatness.  It's a preposterous renter at best",Jason,42

Even for all of the bad press that this movie got, and all of the disgruntled viewers who were expecting another horror, this truly is one of my favorites from M. Night Shyamalan - this, along with ""Lady In The Water"" (another MUST have for me), is a movie that I feel compelled to add to my collection. As the other reviewers state, it's not truly scary, but more a suspenseful film, as I actually find ALL of Shyamalan's movies to be. In my humble opinion, he's not trying to provide movies best-suited to Halloween scare-fest marathons, but movies that are suspenseful and thought-provoking. As annoying as some of his ticks may be to some viewers, there's thought put into each of his films, unlike stupid wastes of celluloid like ""Hostel"" and those damned ""Saw"" movies (enough, already)! 

At least after seeing this in the theatre, I felt that I'd gotten my money's worth for the ticket price, and this is definitely a movie that I feel I could watch repeatedly. In my opinion, the social commentary and romantic aspects only add to the viewing experience provided by this film. Don't buy this if you're looking for a horror like ""The Exorcist"" - if that's what you want, buy and watch ""The Exorcist"". If you're looking for a film with twists and turns that tie in to a somewhat deeper meaning, and will have you nodding your head in agreement with the way things play out on screen, buy this movie. Even if you know what happens in the end, I'm sure you'll find yourself wanting to watch it again over time","M.D. Edwards ""Avid Aesthete""",100

And once more he confirms it through this intense and intriguing psychological picture around a notable expert forensic (Denzel Washington)  sadly a bedridden quadriplegic who joins forces with a witty female agent (Angelina Jollie) to intend by all their means to get a mysterious serial killer around the low belly of NYC.

Smart clues, notable shots, first rate direction, kinetic script make of this movie one of the five most solid thrillers in the Nineties according the tradition of Silence of the lambs as well as an underneath homage to ""The rear window"", if you carefully establish the visible connections, due if James Stewart was a visible peeping tom at those times, Denzel Washington is the scrutinizing cyber eye. The paradigm remains, and just the form changes. 

Highly recommended.",Hiram Gomez Pardo,100
